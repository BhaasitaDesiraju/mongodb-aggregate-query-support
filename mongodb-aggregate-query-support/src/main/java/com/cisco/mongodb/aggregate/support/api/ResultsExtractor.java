 *
 * Implementations of this interface give clients full control over the results that
 * have to be returned.  When the aggregate queries are declared to return a DBObject Type
 * callers have the option to provide a concrete implementation of this interface to extract
 * the result into any desired output class type.  Along with the placeholder replacement
 * capability for keys, this approach allows the same query structure to be able to deserialized
 * into different classes.
